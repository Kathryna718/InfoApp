<p>The ZELLE service's principal competitor is PAYPAL and its VENMO payment service. VENMOis more popular, based on public awareness, opinions, polling, and active engagement with users, but ZELLE processes a much larger</p>
<p>dollar volume of money transfers. The two services work very similarly from the user's perspective,both services use email addresses and mobile phone numbers to identify recipients,but VENMO lacks the direct integration with bank institutions that ZELLE has</p>
<p>and ZELLE  money transfers are typically processed more quickly.</p>
<p> <hr>Starting in January 2018, VENMO began to also offer a more rapid transfer option than its typical 1-3 days transfer service,but VENMO charges a fee for service, which ZELLE-affiliated banks currently do not. The ZELLE network itself does not</p>
<p>charge a fee to users for money transfers.Banks are allowed to charge a fee for Zelle transfers involving their accounts,but they have generally not chosen to do so </hr> </p>
<p>VENMO requires its users to set up an account in its system that is separate from an ordinary banking account and is not insured by FDIC or NCUA,which banking accounts are. The VENMO account can be linked to a bank account</p>
<p>so that necessary funds will be automatically withdrawn from there.However, funds can only be withdrawn from a VENMO account by first transferring them to a bank account and then withdrawing the money from the bank account</p>
<p>(a process that adds an extra step and involves some additional delay and possibly a fee).In contrast,ZELLE transfers money directly between banks accounts, so it requires no separate account or extra steps to obtain access to funds.</p>
<p> <hr>ZELLE is also accessible through banking institutions websites and apps as well as through the separate ZELLE mobile app.</p>
<p>VENMO payments can be canceled before they are finalized. This provides some ability to correct accidental payments and rescind transactions that have not proceeded to the satisfaction of the payer.However, it has also enabled</p>
<p>some scammers to exploit the cancellation feature on Craigslist and in other contexts by appearing to transfer money and then canceling the transaction before it is finalized. ZELLE payments to a register user cannot be canceled.</hr> </p>
